# Eq_MMSE&ZF
This repository has been created for the subject ESR from UPC - EETAC. It has three different equalizers file .c

Firstly, welcome UPC's student!

These file have to be upload in the simulator ALOE in "modules/Equalizer" individually. You can choose between two equlizer type, Zero Forcing (ZF) or Minimum Mean-Squared Error (MMSE) and you can observe two type of MMSE equalizer who makes the channel's estimation by SNR or variance, both are effective.
Zero Forcing is the most basic equalizer, it is the most efficient because is so simple, but it could have some error with big noise, for this reason is used MMSE equalizers too, which does a similar channel estimation but that avoids these mistakes with big noise and makes greater results.

Good luck!
